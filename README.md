Installation
============

In a terminal, type the following:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:remi.rerolle/unity-lens-tomboy
    sudo aptitude update
    sudo aptitude install unity-lens-tomboy

The log off and back in. The lens should now be available from the Dash

Usage
=====

Open the Dash, then start typing something. The matching Tomboy notes will be
listed in a dedicated section.

You can also click the Tomboy icon in the list of available lenses. From the
Tomboy lens, you can also enter a search term, and use the filter buttons to
limit your search to some notebooks, or based on modification time.

Gnote compatibility
==============

The lens is also compatible with GNote. Please bear in mind that this has been
roughly tested. Do not hesitate to file issues if anything goes wrong while
using GNote instead of Tomboy.
